v1.0.3
Save compatible. Can be added to existing saves.

- Fixed bug where effect that added a fighter bay didn't work on ships that don't have fighter bays. This fix works retroactively.
- Added weapon OP reduction effect back into the pool, as long as you have the (currently unreleased, but might be released by the time you read this) Liminal v2.0.2.
- Fixed crash in mission refit screen.
- Removed '.git' folder from the zip.

v1.0.2
Save compatible. Can be added to existing saves.

- Higher rarities will have *slightly* higher IV rolls. The opposite is true for lower rarities.
- IVs rolls now follow a normal distribution (for the nerds, it has a standard deviation of 20, and a mean of -10, -5, 0, 5, or 10).
- In compensation for the above, the cost to reroll is now 30% instead of 40%.
- Removed `Liminal.jar` which was there accidentally.
- Things are now highlighted in the tooltip.
- Made some text slightly less cringe. Only slightly.
- Add README.
