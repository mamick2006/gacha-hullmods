Looking around, no-one else seems to notice you, or the strange van. Even ignoring the question of why a van is in the middle of the hallway, the design of the van looks like nothing you've ever seen before, like nothing that comes from this millenia. But people seem to be milling by you without even a glance in your direction.

""Ignore them,"" the man continues. ""They're just NPCs. They can't see me. Well, I guess I'm something of an NPC myself."" He laughs.

""Well, it appears some friends of yours have found something quite interesting. The Liminality (orange emphasis theirs). Or maybe you've already talked to them about it. Or maybe they've delved too deep and brought something terrible here. Maybe you've already fought the big bad, but no spoilers of course."" He shrugs, and leans against the van.

""Your dimensional threshold is being poked by something much bigger than yourself, but it also caught my attention. I have something for you. Free candy, you might say. I might say.""","gacha_hullmods_continue31:You are super excited and jump at the chance

","He shakes his head. ""Oh don't look so worried. I promise it's nothing bad. I'll be gone before you know it, you'll never see me again I assure you. You have your own crisis to worry about! Unless you've already solved all your problems, or you're going to have a nice quiet run. IDK, I'm not your mom.""

""Anyway,"" the man says, clapping his hands. ""You know what every game needs? A good gacha. The joy of rolling, hoping to finally get something good after so many attempts! The elation of finally getting your waifu! The sadness of an empty bank account. It truly is the best.""

""I can exploit that connection that those poor saps have made to give you that privilege! It piggybacks off that connection, not that any of them will ever notice. As an NPC, I can promise you that. No need to thank me.""

""And that's my gift to you! Good luck!""
