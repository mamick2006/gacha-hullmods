Rates, unless you've changed them somehow, are: 1 star (30%%), 2 star (30%%), 3 star (20%%), 4 star (15%%), 5 star (5%%). Pretty generous, right? Usually the 5 star rate is like 1%%!

1 stars will give you negative effects, 2 stars give nothing, 3 stars give a positive effect, 4 stars give a logistic effect, and 5 stars give you a special effect! Aim big! (Disclaimer: Not all effects can be rolled.)

Oh, and to make it more interesting each roll will also give your ship random IVs, shamelessly copied from Pokemon. Each stat will modify the corresponding ship stat by -30%% to 30%% depending on the roll. So you'll need to get doubly lucky to have a good ship!

The stats are: HP (ship hull), ATK (ballistic damage), DEF (armor), SP ATK (energy damage), SP DEF (flux vent/capacity), and SPD (speed, duh).",Roll the Gacha,,graphics/gacha_hullmods/icons/gacha.png

It'll cost you around 40%% of the value of your ship to remove this. I have to make a living somehow.

And may the odds be ever in your favour. Try whaling.

I'll shut up now.",Remove the Gacha,,graphics/gacha_hullmods/hullmods/gacha_remove.png
